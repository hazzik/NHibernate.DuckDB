## A .NET Lib Template repository

This repository is a template for creating a new .NET library. It includes a GitHub Actions workflow that will run tests on every push and publish the library to NuGet on a tag or merge to the main branch.

### Why?

I have a lot of ideas brewing in my head all the time. However, the chores of setting up a new project usually act as a barrier to getting started. Last time, when I had a sparky idea worth implementing, I spent a lot of time setting up the project, and by the time I finished, the idea had faded away. I've lost the spark. 

So, I created this template because I wanted a quick way to create a new library and start working on it without worrying about setting up the project.

This template includes pre-configured things that I usually use in my projects.
